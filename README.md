# 📊 SQL Advance Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the **SQL Data Analytics Portfolio Project**, where I showcase real-world analysis across both **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Advanced Analytics**.

This project is built entirely using **SQL** and structured around a practical, business-first analytics approach — inspired by industry-standard analysis frameworks.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this stage, we explore and understand the raw data to generate baseline insights and detect patterns.

| # | Analysis Type             | Description |
|---|---------------------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Database Exploration**    | Overview of tables, row counts, missing data, schema checks |
| 2️⃣ | **Dimensions Exploration** | Unique values, categories, distributions across fields like Region, Gender, Product Type |
| 3️⃣ | **Date Exploration**       | Date ranges, gaps, periods of activity, trends by day/month/quarter |
| 4️⃣ | **Measures Exploration**   | Basic KPIs such as total sales, total customers, orders count |
| 5️⃣ | **Magnitude Analysis**     | Absolute values such as highest revenue, order size, units sold |
| 6️⃣ | **Ranking**                | Top N / Bottom N analysis for customers, products, and categories |

## 📈 Advanced Analytics

These queries dig deeper into business performance, trends, and patterns to generate strategic insights.

| # | Analysis Type           | Description |
|---|-------------------------|-------------|
| 7️⃣ | **Change-Over-Time**      | Trend analysis over time: monthly sales, revenue growth, seasonality |
| 8️⃣ | **Cumulative Analysis**   | Running totals, lifetime values, active customers over time |
| 9️⃣ | **Performance Analysis**  | Actual vs Target, YoY growth, goal achievement metrics |
| 🔟 | **Part-to-Whole Analysis**| Proportional insights (e.g., % of sales by region/category) |
| 1️⃣1️⃣ | **Data Segmentation**     | Clustering data into segments like New vs Loyal Customers, High vs Low spenders |
| 1️⃣2️⃣ | **Reporting Views**       | Final cleaned and summarized views to be used in dashboards or Power BI reports |
