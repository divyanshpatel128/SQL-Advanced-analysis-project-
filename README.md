# üìä SQL Advance Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the **SQL Data Analytics Portfolio Project**, where I showcase real-world analysis across both **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Advanced Analytics**.

This project is built entirely using **SQL** and structured around a practical, business-first analytics approach ‚Äî inspired by industry-standard analysis frameworks.
